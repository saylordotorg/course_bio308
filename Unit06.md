title: "BIO308: Marine Biology"
course_description: "A detailed introduction to the field of Marine Biology, from a survey of the origin of oceans and their movements to details of marine food webs, life cycles, and marine zonation. Particular emphasis on marine environment and ecology, taxonomy and physiology, and contemporary concerns in the field, including human influences on marine systems."

**Unit 6: Current Topics in Marine Biology** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this final unit, we will shift our focus from what is already known
about Marine Biology to what is currently being learned.  This unit
should give you a sense of the research opportunities that exist in this
field and provide you with a better understanding of the processes
involved in Marine Biology research.  The unit will begin by covering
recent findings on the impact that humans have on ocean ecology.  We
will then look at Marine Biology topics that have emerged in the
mainstream media as well as in scientific journals.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
<span id="cke_bm_576S" style="display: none; "> </span>It should take
you approximately 17 hours to complete this unit and all of its linked

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Distinguish between types of marine pollution in terms of their
    origins and effects.
-   Answer questions about the dynamics of invasive species (e.g. means
    of introduction, reasons for success).
-   Answer questions about global climate change: its origins and
    effects on the marine environment.
-   Discussthe effects of overfishing on marine communities.
-   Describehow marine protected areas (MPAs) are designated and explain

    “farms”—seems like a simple enough solution to the problem of
    overfishing, there are concerns that such farms could cause more
    ecological damage than they prevent unless they are done right.
     Read this article about the subject and watch the very short (1–2
    minute) embedded video about aquaculture.  For “Taming the Blue
