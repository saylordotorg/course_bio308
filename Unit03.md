**Unit 3: Life Cycles** <span id="3"></span> 
*There are many different ways to classify marine animals.  Some of the
most basic have to do with how they develop as embryos; how they
reproduce; and how their offspring develop.  The embryos of only a few
groups of animals, including humans, exhibit deuterostome development;
we share this trait with such unlikely organisms as starfish and sea
urchins! (Deuterostomes are also the only organisms that can have
identical twins, because the fate of embryonic cells is indeterminate.)
Marine organisms have also developed a wide variety of reproductive
strategies to deal with the environmental conditions they face; for
examples, if mates are scarce, or hard to reach, it might be better to
be a simultaneous hermaphrodite: that way anyone you encounter is a
possible mate.  The offspring of marine organisms display a similar
diversity of life stages, appearances, and behaviors.  Because they
exist in an environment that is wet, without the threat of desiccation,
many marine organisms have external reproduction, releasing their
gametes directly into the water; the resulting zygotes travel on the
ocean currents from the moment of their conception.  Many other
organisms release free-swimming larvae that drift as part of the
plankton for days or weeks before metamorphosing.  For organisms that
are slow-moving or sessile (unmoving or attached to a substrate) as
adults, these drifting eggs and larvae provide the only means of
dispersing their populations to other habitats.  *

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
It should take you approximately 4 hours to complete this unit.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.1: 0.5 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.2: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.3: 1.5 hours

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Distinguish between protostome and deuterostome development: know
    which groups of animals go through which type of development and
    know some of the major features of each type of development.
-   Answer questions about different types of reproductive systems
    (including some of the organisms that use each) and demonstrate an
    understanding of the assumed advantages of each.
-   Answer questions about complex vs. simple life cycles, including the
    effects of these cycles on populations and dispersal potential.

     Instructions: In “Ichthyology,” read the section on hermaphroditism
    in fish, focusing in particular on sex change.  Please note that sex
    change occurs in a number of different marine species (including
    some snails, oysters, and shrimp), not just fish. Read the page on
    “Terminology” to understand the size-advantage hypothesis
    (originally put forth by Michael Ghiselin), the model that is
    accepted as the best explanation for the advantages of changing
    sex.

     Instructions: This is an optional resource.  From the Green Porno
    webpage, scroll down to the right-hand tabs that give you a choice
    of watching episodes of “Seduce Me” Season 1 or “Green Porno –
    All.”  Watch these clever, scientifically accurate, and raunchy
    episodes on squid, shrimp, anchovy, elephant seals, starfish,
    whales, anglerfish, barnacles, salmon, and cuttlefish.  Please note,
    however, that the episode on “Limpets” confuses true limpets (which
    look like the ones in the video but do *not* stack) with
    slipper-shell limpets (also called slipper-shell snails, genus
    *Crepidula*), which are not closely related to true limpets but do
    pair or stack up and also change sex.
