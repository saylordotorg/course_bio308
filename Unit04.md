title: "BIO308: Marine Biology"
course_description: "A detailed introduction to the field of Marine Biology, from a survey of the origin of oceans and their movements to details of marine food webs, life cycles, and marine zonation. Particular emphasis on marine environment and ecology, taxonomy and physiology, and contemporary concerns in the field, including human influences on marine systems.

**Unit 4: Marine Life** <span id="4"></span> 
*When children say they want to study marine biology, it usually means
that they want to study whales or dolphins or seals.  Not that there is
anything wrong with that, but it would be a mistake to believe that the
majority of marine animals are whales, dolphins, or seals—or even fish.
 On the contrary, the vast majority of life in the ocean is composed of
creatures with an amazing diversity of body plans and life histories,
and almost all of them are invertebrates.  Unlike vertebrates,
invertebrate animals are not all part of a single phylum; they belong to
many different phyla, each with its own unique characteristics.  In this
unit you will learn about some of the major groups of marine organisms,
vertebrate and invertebrate.  Please note: the subunits below include
taxonomic information on these animals, but do not feel obliged to
memorize them; they are placed there to give you an idea of the
relationships among groups of organisms.*

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Identify organisms within each phylum covered (including,
    occasionally, being able to identify organisms within different
    classes or subclasses) and recognize some traits (anatomical and
    behavioral) specific to each group.
-   Answer questions about the ecological significance of various
    organisms within these phyla/groups.
