Marine Biology is the study of ocean life.  As you might expect, life in
salt water is vastly different from life in a terrestrial or freshwater
environment due to factors like salinity, water circulation, and
atmospheric pressure.  How, for example, can organisms living in salt
water avoid dehydration?  How do organisms living in the depths of the
ocean handle the immense pressure?  How do the environmental factors in
marine communities affect biodiversity?  How do some animals manage to
alternate between the demands of terrestrial life and the demands of
marine life?  In this course, you will learn the answers to these
questions and more.  This course will touch on a number of different
subfields of biological study (including biochemistry, physiology,
zoology, botany, and ecology) within the context of the ocean
environment. You will start by learning about the ocean itself and its
physical properties, as these properties influence the abundance,
distribution, diversity, physiology, and behavior of marine organisms. 
You will also learn about the specific environmental challenges facing
marine life as well as the physiological and behavioral adaptations that
have resulted from these challenges.  You will then learn about the life
cycles of marine organisms—what they eat and how they reproduce—before
examining in some depth a number of the most common taxa of marine
species.  Once you have a sense of the biodiversity of oceanic life, you
will be able to examine the interrelationships between species in
different marine communities.  The course will conclude with a look at
current research in marine biology. This course will prepare you for
further study within the field of Marine Biology, but students planning
to pursue other subfields will also find this course of use in terms of
learning how alternative environments affect life.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:  
  

-   Compare and contrast ocean and terrestrial environments, and
    describe the properties of the marine environment that are
    associated with specific marine adaptations.
-   List the members of marine food webs and, based on descriptions of
    specific species, identify their roles within food webs and the
    effects of changes in their abundance on overall food-web dynamics.
-   Describe the difference between various life-history types (e.g.
    gonochoristic species vs. sex changers vs. simultaneous
    hermaphrodites; complex vs. simple life history), and identify the
    physiological and ecological conditions under which certain
    life-history traits are considered to be advantageous over others.
-   List and identify phyla/species of marine organisms, and describe
    their taxonomic relationships and the fundamental characteristics of
    their groups.
-   Distinguish between different marine zones in terms of their biotic
    and abiotic characteristics and the factors that affect their
    communities.
-   Design a marine-protected area based on the organisms or region in
    need of protection.
-   Explain the major types, causes, and effects of marine threats such
    as pollution, overfishing, global warming and ocean acidification,
    and invasive species, as well as describe the consequences of these
    threats for marine communities and organisms.
-   Analyze current research in marine biology, evaluating the
    interpretation and results of these experiments.

### Course Information

Welcome to Biology 308.  Below, please find some general information on
the course and its requirements.

**Course Designer**: Olivia V. Ambrogio

**Primary Resources**: This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  The major resources used in this course follow:

-   The MarineBio Conservation Society’s
    [*MarineBio*](http://marinebio.org/) website
-   The University of Michigan Museum of Zoology’s [*Animal Diversity
    Web*](http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/index.html)
-   The University of California, Berkeley’s [Museum of Paleontology
    site](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/)
-   McGraw Hill: Dr. Peter Castro and Dr. Michael Huber’s [*Marine
    Biology* online
    textbook](http://www.mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780077221249.html)

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Although certain web media and readings are listed as “optional,” I urge
you to explore them as well, as they were included in order to give you
the fullest picture of the subject of marine biology and the ways in
which accurate scientific information can be used to delight while
educating.  You will also need to complete:

-   Unit 2 Quiz
-   Subunit 4.7 Quiz
-   Subunit 4.8 Quiz
-   Unit 4 Quiz
-   Subunit 5.2.2 Quiz
-   Subunit 5.2.3 Quiz
-   Subunit 5.2.4 Quiz
-   Subunit 5.2.5 Quiz
-   Subunit 5.2.7 Quiz
-   Subunit 6.1.5 Quiz
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the resources in each unit and the quizzes listed above.

 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of **60 hours**
to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help
you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over
the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 5 hours. Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 and 1.2
(a total of 1 hour) on Monday night; subunit 1.3 (a total of 1.5 hours)
on Tuesday night; subunit 1.4 (a total of 1.5 hours) on Wednesday;
subunit 1.5 (a total of 1 hour) on Thursday; etc.

**Tips/Suggestions**: The course has a scaffold structure so that each
unit’s information builds on another’s, so that words like “euphotic
zone” will have already been familiar to you from Unit 1 when you
encounter them again in Unit 5, and so that you will have a sense of
what kinds of animals are present at what point in a marine food web
before you learn about the details of a particular phylum or species.
 Take ample notes on terms and concepts and to refer back to earlier
resources if you encounter a term or concept that feels familiar but
that you cannot quite remember.  Marine biology is a lot of fun, but it
encompasses a lot of information.
