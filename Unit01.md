**Unit 1: The Ocean Environment** <span id="1"></span> 
*While the ecology and community relationships of marine organisms are
in some ways very similar to those of terrestrial organisms, species
that live in water deal with a very different environment than we do and
are affected by the properties of that environment.  For example, the
coloring, or lack thereof, of animals in deep water is related to the
wavelengths of light that are transmitted so far below the surface. 
Also, organisms that live in the “intertidal zone,” the area that is
covered by water at high tide but exposed to the air at low tide, alter
their behavior and physiology in response to the movements of tides.
Understanding the abiotic (non-living) aspects of this medium will give
you a better sense of the world in which marine organisms live. This
unit will introduce you to the ocean, giving you an overview of its
chemistry, its physical properties, and some of the oceanographic
features that influence the physiology, ecology, and behavior of the
organisms within it.  *

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
It should take you approximately 5 hours to complete this unit.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 0.5 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2: 0.5 hour

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
  
-   Answer questions about plate tectonics (including identifying types
    of margins/plate boundaries from given examples and demonstrating
    their understanding of the theory of continental drift).
-   Explain what causes tides, when one would see high vs. low tides,
    and describe the differences between spring and neap tides.
-   Describe the properties of seawater, and identify the ways that
    these properties have affected the behavior/physiology of marine vs.
    land organisms.
-   Answer questions about wave properties and movements and identify
    types of waves.
-   Explain the ways in which oceans affect climate and vice versa (e.g.
    upwelling).

     Instructions: We tend to think of water as something that is easy
    to swim in and easy to move through; if your goggles came off
    underwater, it would be no trouble to reach out and grab them. But
    water is a very different, and much thicker, medium for small
    aquatic organisms.  For them, movement requires different
    strategies, and grabbing something through water is as difficult as
    it is for you to scoop a piece of an egg shell out of a bowl of raw
    eggs using a fork. Read the section “How to Swim in Corn Syrup” and
    watch the accompanying videos, which demonstrates how small marine
    organisms that exist at low Reynolds numbers (where the ratio of
    inertia to viscosity is low) move in an environment that feels much
    denser to them than it does to larger swimmers.
