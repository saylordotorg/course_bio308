**Unit 2: Marine Food Webs** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, you will begin your introduction to marine life by
looking at how organisms are connected through trophic levels, or food
chains.  This unit will address what types of organisms are primary
producers, consumers, and detritivores (deposit feeders) and will
examine their interactions.  Although some animal species will be
specifically named in this section, for the moment focus on the
relationships among them rather than on their names or taxonomic
affiliations; species will be described in more detail in Unit 3.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
It should take you approximately 5 hours to complete this unit and all
of its linked materials.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.1: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.3: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.4: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.5: 1 hour

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Explainfood webs (structure, roles of species) and describe the flow
    of energy within them (including assimilation efficiency up the food
    chain).
-   Identify primary producers, consumers, and detritivores.
-   Answer questions about the anatomy and function of macroalgae.
-   Answer questions about phytoplankton, including their vital role in
    primary production, and identify limiting factors for them.
-   Answer questions about locations of animals in areas of the marine
    environment (plankton, benthos, etc.) and identify organisms’
    locations as a product of their life-cycle stage (e.g. belonging to
    the meroplankton vs. holoplankton).

    Productivity](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-014-introductory-biology-spring-2005/video-lectures/19-regulation-of-productivity/)”
    (Adobe Flash, iTunes U, and MP3)  
        
     Instructions: Watch Lecture 19 (“Regulation of Productivity”) in
    its entirety (47:20 minutes).  This lecture will cover Unit 2 (and
    will serve as a refresher for material in Unit 1).  Because the
    first part of the lecture focuses on terrestrial ecosystems, begin
    watching 14 minutes into the video lecture.  MIT Opencourseware
    gives you the option of watching this video from its site or
    downloading it via iTunes; do whichever you prefer.  Approximately
    two or three minutes of lecture (in the section on diatoms) have no
    video, as images were removed due to copyright concerns, but the
    rest of the video is intact.

**2.1 Primary Producers** <span id="2.1"></span> 
**2.1.1 Algae** <span id="2.1.1"></span> 
*Note: The appropriate taxonomic classification of marine algae
(seaweeds and kelp) is a much-debated topic, and not all “seaweeds” are
classified in the same general taxa—or even in the same phylum.  It is
generally agreed, however, that algae are not true plants, as they lack
vasculature and root systems and reproduce not by flowering but via
spores.  For these reasons, even though they are large, multicellular
organisms, they are sometimes placed in the kingdom Protista.*

    read only the subsection “Characteristics.”  Do not concern yourself
    with the details of the chemical composition of the algal types.  In
    “Dimethylsulfide Emission,” read the Introduction, The Production of
    DMS, and DMS Effects on Grazing; this will introduce you to some of
    the chemicals that are produced and/or released by many marine algae
    and microalgae, which both affect larger biogeochemical cycles and
    function as inducible chemical defenses.
