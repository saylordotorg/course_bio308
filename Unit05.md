title: "BIO308: Marine Biology"
course_description: "A detailed introduction to the field of Marine Biology, from a survey of the origin of oceans and their movements to details of marine food webs, life cycles, and marine zonation. Particular emphasis on marine environment and ecology, taxonomy and physiology, and contemporary concerns in the field, including human influences on marine systems."

**Unit 5: Marine Ecology** <span id="5"></span> 
*The marine environment is not homogeneous.  Variations in oceanic
habitats (i.e.  changes in temperature, depth, and light penetrance)
provide opportunities for a variety of communities to develop.  We will
begin this unit by learning the three major ocean zones—intertidal,
benthic, and pelagic—and will continue on to study seven different types
of communities that occur in or around the ocean.  We will look at the
typical species, adaptations, food webs, population, and material cycles
within each of these communities.      *
